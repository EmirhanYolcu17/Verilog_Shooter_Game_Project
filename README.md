## üéÆ Project Overview
This project was developed as the **term project for the EE314 Digital Electronics Laboratory course**, where we were tasked with creating an **isometric shooter game** implemented entirely in **Verilog HDL** and deployed on an **FPGA platform** using a VGA display.

The game is inspired by the classic *Space Invaders*, featuring a **central spaceship** that rotates to defend itself against waves of enemies approaching from multiple directions.  
The player can choose between three different **shooting modes**, each with unique damage and spread patterns.  
All game logic ‚Äî including object rendering, score tracking, collision detection, and enemy spawning ‚Äî was designed in hardware without using any microcontroller.

## üß© System Architecture
The design consists of multiple Verilog modules, each responsible for a distinct functionality:
- **Shooter Module:** Core gameplay logic ‚Äî enemy dynamics, shooting, collisions, and scoring  
- **VGA Controller:** Handles pixel-level rendering of the spaceship, enemies, and background  
- **Ship Direction Module:** Tracks user input from FPGA keys to control spaceship rotation  
- **Random Number Generator (LFSR):** Ensures randomized enemy spawning and types  
- **Mode Selection Logic:** Uses FPGA switches to change firing modes in real-time

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics
- **Spaceship Rotation:** Controlled via FPGA keys (CW / CCW)
- **Enemy Spawning:** Randomized direction and type generation with LFSR  
- **Enemy Types:** Three enemy classes with different health and shapes  
- **Shooting Modes:**
  - Mode 0 ‚Äî Wide spread, low damage  
  - Mode 1 ‚Äî Balanced spread and damage  
  - Mode 2 ‚Äî Focused shot, high damage  
- **Score System:** Incremented in real time upon destroying enemies and displayed on VGA  
- **Game Over:** Triggered when any enemy reaches the center (the player‚Äôs spaceship)
